    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Born and raised by Filipino parents, I grew up in Stamford CT.  I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Connecticut in May 2017.  I majored in Digital Media and Design with a focus in DMD Strategies for Business and minored in Women's Gender, and Sexuality Studies.

  <h3 class="w3-center">Part 1: </h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em> Roots of Pinayism<br></em></p><br>
  <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ever since I was a child, the idea of becoming something other than a nurse or some medical related professional was an unimaginable one. My parents were both in the medical field, as were a lot of my cousins, and our Filipino family friends. Many of the Filipinos who were brought over by my father applied to become registered nurses. Even my older sister, who entered college with the  notion that she would graduate college with an  with an undergraduate degree in Linguistics and a minor in Englishapplied to UConn's Nursing program in her sophomore year. She later became a Pediatric/Labor and Delivery nurse at Greenwich Hospital. 
  </p>
  <p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Upon entering college, I went along a different path. I went from an Anthropology major my freshman year to a Business major my sophomore year and finally set upon degree in Digital Media and Design: Strategies for Business major with a minor in Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies. Of course, I ran into resistance and criticism from my family members at every step of the way. When I told them what I had applied as an Anthropology major, they laughed and asked me "What can you possibly make on a salary of an Anthropologist?". I decided that as much as human culture excited and engaged me, I wasn't about to put my parents through the financial burden of paying for undergraduate and graduate school. While they didn't have to pay for my older sister to attend college due to her scholarship, I wasn't so lucky. When I made the decision to switch out of Anthropology, I applied to the School of Business. I would always hear my parents gush over the fact that accountants make a lot of money. Two semesters into that venture and I was already regretting my decision. The first semester, consisting of the basics, was simple enough, but getting past the mathematically-intense classes were exhausting. By my second semester, I was already burnt out of my required math classes. One of those tired, inaccurate Asian stereotypes that I could never seem to fulfil was being good at math. Other than the basic math one would  encounter in day-to-day life, I never seemed to be able to make sense of anything else. I had gotten tutors, help from both peers and professors alike and the material just never clicked. That same semester I was taking two intense business math courses in the same day, I also decided to take a beginner's art course, which also was also taught by my advisor. The course became my saving grace, a break from the soul crushing business classes I took. It mirrored the way art created a safe haven for me in my high school days. Ceramics, Sewing, Painting, Drawing... All things I excelled in, but were never encouraged by my parents to pursue as a career.      
  </p>
  <p> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During the midterm critique, my advisor and I also spoke about my next steps from the current semester onward. I told her how the business path was already making me unhappy, but I wanted to also satisfy my parents concerns about job and financial stability. But that conflict of my desires of a career that both played up my creative and visual strengths and that satisfied my parent's fears. How my parent's criticism of the careers I wanted to pursue was suffocating. When I spoke to my advisor about the matter, she said that their fears of economic instability in my career choice was based on old, outdated information. She suggested I apply to the Digital Media and Design department that just opened up on our commuter campus. Twenty-four hours later, I had scrounged up a complete art portfolio to present to the head of the new department. After that, I was accepted into the department.
 </p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp News that neither of my parents took well. For the first semester of being a DMD major, my parents did nothing more than criticize and question my choices in my career. Like they somehow knew more about the career path I was taking, a career that they didn't even know existed until I told them about it. I sent them descriptions and annual salary stats to easy their frazzled minds. I even sent my dad to the DMD discovery night, an event for high school students and their parents. After all my efforts to get them to understand that my change in major was not a waste, it never seemed to be enough. Even when I’m about to graduate with my degree in DMD in a few months, they still seem to question whether the choices I made will pan out, something they never did with my older sister.   
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp While the initial rejection and criticism of my career choices stung for a few months, it occurred to me that the way they went about their criticism wasn't personal. It seemed to be more deep rooted than outright skepticism. It wasn't until I had looked into the history of Filipino nurses did I see how ingrained the idea was in Filipino culture. Following the colonizing of the Philippines by the United States after the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), the United States passed The Pensionado Act of 1903.  
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "The Pensionado Act of 1903, or Act 854, refers to the law which allowed qualified Filipino students to study in the United States. Passed on the 26th of August 1903 by Governor General William Howard Taft's government; through the Philippine Commission, this act provided funds for such students, called Pensionados, to acquire their college degrees at American schools. 103 students comprised the first wave of pensionados. During the first decade of the American occupation, most of the pensionados were women from the elite class (the same class who had access to better education in the late Spanish period). However, under the American educational system, educational opportunities in the Philippines became more democratic, so much so that many of the later pensionados were promising Filipinos who were not necessarily wealthy."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "After nursing students finish school in the Philippines, very few of them end up pursuing a nursing career in the Philippine capital city of Manila. Those who do gain work experience in hopes of eventually immigrating to the US, Canada, or even Europe. With the promise of a generous salary and a life free of financial hardship, the US continues to capture the ambition of Filipino nurses. America is, after all, the land of milk and honey."
 </p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp That's more than 100 years of Filipina women coming overseas to lead better lives, taking any chance they got to rise above the poverty stricken Motherland.  It was also my maternal grandparents' story. While the colonialist nature stains the history, laws like The Pensionado Act of 1903 normalized Filipino migration to the United States. My maternal grandparents were able to escape the Marcos rule during the 1970's in order to raise my mother and her 8 other siblings in the United States. She was a Pediatric Doctor, and worked later worked for Blue Shield while in the United States until her retirement. My grandfather continued his work as an Engineer until his retirement. For many within my family, this is how it's always been, the way to a better life. And here I was, breaking apart from a culturally ingrained tradition that served as a vehicle to a financially stable life. 
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The connection to medicine, healing, and feminist ideologies goes back even further. Before Spain completely colonized the nation that would become the Philippines, women were seen as equal to men. The biggest embodiment feminist roots in Pre-Colonial was the Babylan, a prominent priestess or shaman. Lilia Quindoza-Santiago in "Roots of Feminist Thought in The Philippines", notes that "...it would not be difficult for women to shoulder the responsibility of being the spiritual and cultural leader of the community... Because woman was perceived as bearing young in the same way that plants came to fruition, she is looked upon as the repository of knowledge about life and the environment; her ability to sound nature's mysterious and oracular depths was recognized; she it was who could decipher the myths and legends that originated from nature. "
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With all of this in mind... does my career path speak to rejection of cultural traditions born from deeply- ingrained colonialism? Or does it reject the feminist roots of my foremothers?

  <p class="w3-center"><em> Assimilation,Erasure of Identity, and Just Trying to Exist.
<br></em></p><br>
  <p>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Honestly, I think the effects the constant colonialism. As a country, The Philippines had almost always been in another country's control : Spain through colonialism, Japan through World War II, the United States of America through colonialism. So it feels like the Philippines never really had it's own autonomous development. Sending people to work overseas and having transnational families are also a huge part of the Filipino culture. If you are lucky to escape the extreme levels of poverty, you were more likely to leave Philippines and became a Pinoy Overseas Worker. You would work in the country you immigrated to and send money to your family back home in order for them to escape poverty, with the hope that they would also immigrate to where you were. With all these factors, I think that's why the Filipino experience is forgotten when they start to live in countries like the United States…  It's almost like assimilation is our identity."
  </p>
  <p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I stared at my Facebook messenger, at the response I was about to send to my friend Raul. A response that I mulled in my head for a while because it brought out emotions in me that were always there, but were never connected until that moment.   
  </p>
  <p> 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Raul and I have known each other for years: in high school we hung out in the same friend group and had a few classes together. I was also lucky enough to be a part of his first year of college before he transferred out to the local community college. Throughout my college career, he and I seemed to bond over the feminist discourse. And videos of my derpy bulldog. But mostly feminist discourse. Even as a male Latinx feminist, he still could empathize with a female Filipinx peminist like myself.
 </p>
  <p> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So it wasn't a surprise that Raul had messaged me after seeing a video I had posted about the Filipino Experience on the East Coast of the United States. It was posted to the "Asian American Life" Facebook Page, and was produced by the Filipino American National Historical Society's Metro NY Chapter. The video highlights the forgotten Filipino Experience and migration of Filipinos on the East Coast of the United States, and how it differed from the West Coast Filipino Experience. What struck a nerve with Raul was the fact that in 1911, Filipinos were used as attractions at the Coney Island Amusement park. They were dressed as "savages of the Philippines" at Coney Island's Dreamland Circus Sideshow, wearing outdated native Filipino clothing. So naturally, we talked about the video, with Raul's surprise of the "savages of the Philippines" as the jumping off point .
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As I went through my Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies minor, I noticed that Asian and Asian Feminism wasn't spoken about that often. In the six classes I took for the WGSS Minor, I could count the number of times Asians were mentioned in the reading materials given in all six classes with my fingers. So, I was often researching a lot of the Asian Feminism, Asian Issues and Pinayism in my free time. I wanted to be well-versed in the issues that plagued Asians with a feminist lense.
</p>
  <p> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Any time I would insert and apply Asian Feminism and Pinayism to what was being discussed, I would either get the deadly awkward silence or the response of “ you talk about Asian Feminism and Pinayism waaaaay too much ” from my feminist peers. Even within an intersectional feminist space, I felt alienated. Like I was  still the model minority even within this space. Like what I had to say from my Peminist perspective was invalid because it was Peminist and Pinayist, not Feminist. Luckily for me, Raul was one of the few feminists that was intrigued by my experiences as a Peminist, which made him ask the question: "Why do you think, in your experience, your families (and possibly other Filipino people) stress assimilation over acknowledging cultural history?"      
 </p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's here where I went from being excited about talking about the Filipino Experience to unsure and introspective."Assimilation is our identity" was the phrase that stuck in my mind. Cultural assimilation can be spontaneously adopted due to its political relevance, or to its perceived superiority. My experience in interacting with other Filipinos seems to confirm this, this notion that the US is overall superior to the Philippines so the goal of all Filipinos is to successfully emulate the American dream. 
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In a subsection of the Introduction of "Pinay Power : Theorizing The Filipina/American Experience" is where I found why "Assimilation is our identity", which weighed heavy in my mind. The name of the subsection was  Legacies of Erasure. "The themes of lost identities and histories dominate Filipino American Cultural Studies. Many critics delineate how a heritage of dual colonizations ( first by Spain and then the United States), coupled with American Cultural imperialism has left an indelible mark on the Filipino American psyche... Many Filipino Americans still regard their own culture as inferior (that is, compared to America's) which further reinforces the Filipino's invisibility. It is no wonder that second- and third-generation Filipino Americans feel they are neither here nor there, perambulating between a culture that alienates them and a culture they know nothing about or are ashamed of."
  </p>
  <p>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The shame that Melinda L. De Jesus describes in "Legacies of Erasure" seemed to permeate through the lives of me and the other Filipinos around me, inflicted by others or self-inflicting. I had a friend who was really into anime. There was a day that we had spoken about anime, and there was a something that he had mentioned he saw in an slice of life anime that I didn't know was culturally ingrained in Japanese culture. He gleefully exclaimed that he was "more Asian than me" because I didn't know something about a culture that I am not a part of. This third generation Italian-American "feminist" man who has never studied Japanese culture academically outside of watching anime, who has never been outside the tri-state area, let alone outside of the country to experience Japanese, Filipino, or any other culture was claiming to be more Asian than I. Someone who had lived her entire life as a Asian in a predominately white neighborhood, with all the shame, humiliation, and isolation that comes with it. I knew all these things, that just because I'm Filipino, my experience is not the same as a Japanese person, a Indian person, or any other Asian person. Although we belong in the grouping of Asian, each Asian country has issues specific to them that the others may not have. I knew all this logic and facts, yet the shame left me quiet. It still makes me feel like shit.  
  <p> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This memory also brings forth a quote from a book that I recently purchased, "Permanent Alien: An Asian American Comic Anthology". An anthology created by four Asian American Rhode Island School of Design Students: Hanna Cha, Mariel Rodriguez, Jean Wei, and Michelle Zhuang. Before you jump into the colorful comic strips, a small introduction can be found. This small paragraph in size 18 font that barely covers the pages is the embodiment of Asian-American Diaspora: "Permanent Alien. What's a permanent alien? We're not experts, but we're thinking about that feeling of always being perceived as being someone - or something - from someplace far away, when you're just trying to exist right here." Relating it back to Pinayism, I think it embodies the reason why I even decided to pursue writing about my own experiences : I'm trying to prove that I just exist, and that I refuse to let my cultural legacy to disappear.

  <p class="w3-center"><em> Roots of Activism
<br></em></p><br>
  <p>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We're all just sitting here. Stunned, angry, afraid. The Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies Center, the safe haven we all grew to love, is covered in a thick blanket of discomfort. He won. All of his toxic ideology could become law. And we all just sat here, trying to figure out what to do next.  Some of us were quiet, sitting and reflecting some of us were crying, and some of us were cracking jokes to make the stark reality.
  </p>
  <p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Twenty-four hours later, we found the strength to rally. We stood on campus grounds and banded together. We took what we learned in all of our class and applied them to what was happening in front of us.  
  </p>
  <p> 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A large crowd of students and faculty Surprisingly, one of my Digital Media Design professors had attended our Anti-Trump Protest Rally. The European-born American, who in the years I’ve known him wasn’t politically active, wrote to myself and two other Digital Media and Design girls who had also organized the rally. This professor thank us for what we did, and was energized to be a more proactively informed professor and citizen. 
 </p>
  <p> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Fast forward to the next semester, RESIST culminates into an organized group of students and alumni preparing multiple events over the next semester. These events were based off themes and inaccuracies that the 45th U.S. President had boldly proclaimed as true. The first event was based on Racial Injustice. So we had student and faculty come up and speak about Race while those in the audience could write a postcard to local officials so they could express their opinions for or against certain bills and laws coming up. 
</p>
  <p> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As I looked at the speeches that were going to be presented, I became a bit self-conscious about what I was presenting compared to everyone else. My speech wasn't as a Danielle speech, a Dani speech, a Simon speech, a Danilo speech,a Raul speech or a Darlene speech. And there were still some feminists who questioned if I had the right to be there. But, my speech was mine to share. Everything I had learned had led up to this, what was the point of having done all this research if I didn’t show anything for it?So I oped for Resistance and Struggles are Sisters, a poem that reflected how I felt on the chosen theme:
</p>
  <p> 
    <i>
 "&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Before I start, I have to explain a few things. Since Filipino history isn't really taught in the public school system, I have to explain what Pinay means: 
'Pinay is a word that represents an identity that has been rearticulated to connote self-determination, strength, and sisterhood. A Pinay is a woman of F/Pilipino descent in American, or F/Pilipino American.'
  I chose to present Resistance and Struggles are Sisters because even though it comes from the perspective of Filipino
History, it embodies a lot of racial issues and struggles that others can identify with.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After I had presented the poem, I felt like I did belong up there. A lot of the doubts I had about my own validity as a F/Peminist were laid to rest. The time when activism was only held by the "privileged" few seems to have passed.      In his recent TED X BinghamtonU talk Social Activism is the New Civil Rights Movement , Ranier Maningding explains that  "Now that activism is accessible, it's also incredibly inclusive. An inclusive revolution is an effective revolution". Ranier Maningding is a Filipino-American advertising copywriter and writer for The Love Life of an Asian Guy (LLAG), a blog devoted to discussing race, politics and pop culture. Maningding's words ring true: now is the time to act and engage in order to create change.

  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp These rallies and events were my first steps into the proactive stages of being a Peminist. Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies gave me the knowledge and the experience , Digital Media and Design gave me the tools to create content that expressed what I had learned. My professors informed me but also instilled compassion within me, my friends encouraged me and showed me new perspectives. Now that I have had these learning experiences, I can move onto the next chapter: applying them outside of academics. My journey through this movement isn't over, it has just begun.
